## About
Made for my fourth semester. The goal of this project was to create a real time gesture recognition app which is able to recognize american sign language gestures. Made with Python and Jupyter Notebook. The [model](./model) that this app uses is able to recognize gestures for digits '0' to '9'. The [notebook](Gesture%20recognition.ipynb) created for this project is flexible, meaning that you are able to use it to create a model with different datasets.

## Features
- __real time:__ gesture recognition in real time
- __multiple hands:__ multiple hands can be recognized at once
- __ambidextrous:__ recognize gestures on both left and right hand
- __debug:__ visualize hand skeleton, confidence & more
